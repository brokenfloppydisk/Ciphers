# Instructions
* In your program, you must include student-developed program code that contains the following:
    * Instructions for input from one of the following:
        * the user (including user actions that trigger events)
        * a device
        * an online data stream
        * a file
    * Use of at least one list (or other collection type) to represent a collection of data that is stored and used to manage program complexity and help fulfill the program’s purpose
    * At least one procedure that contributes to the program’s intended purpose, where you have defined:
        * the procedure’s name
        * the return type (if necessary)
        * one or more parameters
    * An algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration that is in the body of the selected procedure
    * Calls to your student-developed procedure 
    * Instructions for output (tactile, audible, visual, or textual) based on input and program functionality

# Notes

## Program Function
* Aristocrat cipher generator
* Gets quotes from a database (needs to be credited to not get marked down for plagiarism)
    * Can also use http requests to get
* The ciphertext and plaintext can be stored in lists
    * Using dictionaries would be better, but using lists is required
* Sequencing, selection, and iteration can be shown by applying the substitution
    * can also be shown through formatting a quote as a patristocrat
* Output can be through the command line, and the ciphers could also be outputted as txt files

## Programming specifics
* Python
* Make liberal use of type annotations and docstrings to comment out the code
